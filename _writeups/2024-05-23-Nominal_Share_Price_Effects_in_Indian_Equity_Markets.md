#### Research Abstract

This paper explores the characteristics of Indian stocks when categorized on the basis of nominal prices. Special focus is on the Penny Stocks which are the least price category. We find that penny stocks in India are categorized by higher raw returns, very low share of market capitalization and turnover and generally suffer from inadequate corporate governance. However, when adjusted for extreme 1%ile returns, penny stocks generate less return at lower risk compared to high denomination stocks. Penny stock returns are well explained by the standard empirical asset pricing models. However, when adjusted for corporate governance, they exhibit extra abnormal returns. Absence of a negative alpha for penny stocks in asset pricing returns models is consistent with the stubborn survival of this investment class despite the lack of clarity regarding their function in asset markets.
