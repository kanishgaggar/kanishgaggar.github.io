### Resources in Vulkan

1. Buffer - raw arrays of bytes.
2. Images - multidimensional data with associated metadata.

#### Buffers

Three important data structure related to creating a buffer

1. **VkBuffer** - creates a buffer, but doesn't yet allocate the memory for it.
2. **VkDeviceMemory** - located on device. Though this memory has to be allocated (vkAllocateMemory) and freed (vkFreeMemory) explicitly, the handle to buffer is the first data structure (VkBufferMemory) and that is which is used for binding buffers. (Question: Where else do we explicitly refer to VkDeviceMemory ?)
3. **void* mappedMemory** - located on host. For copying any data to VkDeviceMemory just copy the data to this mapped memory on host.
